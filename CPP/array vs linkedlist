Arrays:

Contiguous Memory: Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, meaning that elements are stored one after another in memory.
Random Access: Elements in an array can be accessed directly using their indices. This allows for constant-time access to elements.
Fixed Size: The size of an array is fixed and determined at compile time. Once created, the size cannot be changed.
Memory Efficiency: Arrays can be more memory-efficient than linked lists, especially for primitive data types, because they do not require extra memory for pointers.
Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations in arrays, especially in the middle, can be inefficient as elements may need to be shifted to accommodate the changes.
Dynamic Arrays: Some languages provide dynamic arrays (e.g., C++ std::vector, Java ArrayList) that automatically resize themselves when needed, providing a compromise between arrays and linked lists.
Linked Lists:

Non-contiguous Memory: Linked lists store elements in nodes, with each node containing the element and a pointer to the next (and optionally previous) node. Nodes are not required to be stored contiguously in memory.
Sequential Access: Linked lists require sequential access starting from the head (or tail for doubly linked lists) to access elements. Random access is not efficient.
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink in size as needed since memory is allocated dynamically.
Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations, especially at the beginning or end of the list, are efficient in linked lists as they involve updating pointers, with no need for shifting elements.
Memory Overhead: Linked lists require additional memory for storing pointers/references to the next (and previous for doubly linked lists) node, making them less memory-efficient compared to arrays, especially for primitive data types.
Types of Linked Lists: There are different types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, each with its own characteristics and use cases.
When to Use Which:

Use arrays when:
You need random access to elements based on indices.
The size of the collection is known and fixed, or it doesn't change frequently.
Memory efficiency is a concern, especially for primitive data types.
Use linked lists when:
Dynamic resizing is needed or the size of the collection is unknown.
Frequent insertion or deletion operations are expected, especially at the beginning or end of the collection.
You can tolerate the memory overhead of storing pointers/references.
