In programming, a vector typically refers to a dynamic array-like data structure provided by many programming languages and libraries. It is a container that stores a sequence of elements and dynamically resizes itself to accommodate new elements when needed.

In C++, the standard library provides a container called std::vector, which is a versatile and efficient implementation of a dynamic array. Here are some key characteristics of std::vector:

Dynamic Size: Unlike traditional arrays, std::vector can dynamically grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed. Memory is allocated dynamically, and the container handles resizing internally.
Random Access: std::vector provides constant-time access to elements based on their indices, similar to arrays. This allows for efficient random access and element modification.
Contiguous Memory: Like arrays, elements in a std::vector are stored in contiguous memory locations. This ensures efficient memory access and cache utilization.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion: While insertion and deletion operations may require resizing the underlying array and moving elements, std::vector provides efficient operations for adding or removing elements at the end of the vector (push_back, pop_back) due to amortized constant-time complexity.
Standard Library Support: std::vector is part of the C++ Standard Library, making it widely available and portable across different platforms and compilers.
Template Class: std::vector is a template class, allowing it to store elements of any data type. This provides flexibility and type safety.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Create an empty vector of integers
    std::vector<int> vec;

    // Add elements to the vector
    vec.push_back(10);
    vec.push_back(20);
    vec.push_back(30);

    // Access elements using indices
    std::cout << "Elements of the vector: ";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << vec[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Iterate over elements using range-based for loop
    std::cout << "Elements of the vector (using range-based for loop): ";
    for (int element : vec) {
        std::cout << element << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
